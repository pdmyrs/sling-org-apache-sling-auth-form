How to run in AEM 6.4

## Setup

###  1. After building, install the bundle using the Web Console (thereâ€™s no package)

###  2. Check the Sling Authenticator console
* Make sure the service is running on path '/'. 
* Use the ConfigMgr to change the service.ranking in the Sling Form Based Authentication Handler config to 200000. It now is the highest service running on path '/', so it will be the first Authenticator in line to handle requests.

### 3. Add sling source for running through the debugger
